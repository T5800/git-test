here , we can use like "GetWeatherByUrl" to get the info from
the website...and then , we charge the regex method , e.g.    
Pattern p = Pattern.compile(regex);
Matcher m = p.matcher(message);
we use the above method to get the content we want, such as the  
"weather", "Mobile Address", "the Bus line" and so on...
enjoy it!
